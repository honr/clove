* What is Clove:
Clove is a small daemon and its corresponding client that runs
services and takes care of communications with them over AF_UNIX sockets.
Additionally, a java native library is included that allows you to
write clove services using JVM.
Also, a clove-clojure service is included that let's you start and use
a Clojure instance.


* Obtaining Clove:
$ git clone git://github.com/honr/clove.git

* Installation:
$ make install

Note: currently there are some hardcoded assumptions about where we
      install clove and which paths are significant.  We expect to fix
      this ugliness soon.  In short, we install everything under
      ~/.local/, and use ~/.local/var/run/clove/ for AF_UNIX socket
      paths.

Using Clove:
We assume that you have something like the following in your
~/.bashrc, effectively adding two directories to your PATH:

----------------------------- BEGIN SNIPPET -----------------------------
SYSOSTYPE="$(uname)"
case "${SYSOSTYPE}" in
    Darwin)
	SYSOSTYPE=mac
	;;
    Linux)
	SYSOSTYPE=linux
	;;
esac

CPUARCH="$(uname -m)"
case "${CPUARCH}" in
    i*86)
	CPUARCH=x86
	;;
esac
SYSARCH="${SYSOSTYPE}-${CPUARCH}"

export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin/${SYSARCH}:${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"
------------------------------ END SNIPPET ------------------------------

Now you can run the clove daemon:
$ clove -Wwd
or, in the future when we automatically take care of wiping dead
socket paths:
$ clove -d

Currently, you might want to run the clove daemon in a screen session,
to be able to see some debugging output.  In the future you are going
to have a choice for sending the output to the syslog facility.

Once the daemon is running, you can use it:
$ clove -c clojure -e "(+ 1 2 4 8)"

* Clove Services and their Configuration Files

Each clove service is an executable file in your path, for instance
`~/.local/bin/clove-clojure'. Each service can (and should) have a
configuration file outlining how to run it (shebang), and what
environment variables to set.  Parsing is very rudimentary: 

1. The shebang line is used to exec the rest of the file (more than two
   args are also accepted).
2. The rest of the file shows what environment variables to set.
example:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.local/lib

In order to differentiate the environment variables based on the OS
and CPU architecture, you can start lines with `/' with the following
format:

/$(uname) $(uname -m)/envvar=...
for example:
/Linux x86/LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/.local/lib/linux-x86
sets the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to
$HOME/.local/lib/linux-x86, only on the Linux x86 platform.

3. Except for the first line, the `#' character start a comment until
   the end of the line.
